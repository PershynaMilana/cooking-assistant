# Cooking Assistant - Frontend

React 19 + TypeScript + Vite client for the [Cooking Assistant](../README.md) platform. It talks to the
[backend](../backend/README.md) API under `/api`. Authentication is a server-set **httpOnly cookie**, so
the client never sees or stores a token - it just sends requests with credentials and lets the browser
carry the cookie.

**Live:** https://cooking-assistant.app

## Tech stack

- **React 19 + TypeScript** - UI
- **Vite 8** - dev server, HMR, production bundler
- **React Router DOM v7** - a data router (`createBrowserRouter`), with `React.lazy` + `Suspense`
  code splitting (one chunk per page) and `useBlocker` support for unsaved-edit guards on forms
- **Redux Toolkit + RTK Query** - server-state caching. A single `baseApi` built on a custom
  `axiosBaseQuery` (routes every request through the shared `apiClient`, never `fetch`, so the auth
  cookie and 401/403 interceptor still apply), with one injected endpoint file per domain under
  `src/redux/services/`. Client/UI state (session, the modal manager, toasts, theme) lives in slices
  under `src/redux/slices/`
- **SCSS modules** - styling, one `.module.scss` per component; no Tailwind
- **axios** - HTTP client, wrapped behind a single shared instance in `src/api/`
- **i18next + react-i18next** - all user-facing strings (one namespace per domain, `en` locale today)
- **Recharts** - charts on the stats page (lazy-loaded)
- **lucide-react** + hand-authored SVG icon components (`src/components/icons/`) - iconography
- **Jest 30 + @swc/jest + React Testing Library + jsdom** - test suite (~224 co-located test files,
  80% coverage gate)

## Running locally

Prefer the repo root: `npm install && npm start` boots backend + frontend together. Use the commands
below only to work on the frontend alone.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # vite dev server -> http://localhost:8080
npm run build        # tsc -b tsconfig.build.json && vite build (the real type-check happens here)
npm run preview      # serve the production dist/
npm run lint         # eslint .
npm run lint:fix     # eslint . --fix
npm run lint:sonarjs # SonarJS static-analysis ruleset
npm run stylelint    # stylelint src/**/*.{css,scss}
npm run typecheck    # tsc -b tsconfig.build.json
npm run test         # jest
npm run test:coverage# jest --coverage (enforces the 80% threshold)
```

Type errors only surface at `npm run build` / `npm run typecheck` (`tsc -b tsconfig.build.json`), not at `npm run dev`. Run
one of them before opening a PR.

## Production (Docker + nginx)

In production the frontend is a static bundle served by nginx. The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) has two stages:

1. **builder** - sets `ARG VITE_API_URL` (baked into the Vite bundle at build time), runs `npm run build`,
   produces `dist/`.
2. **runner** - copies `dist/` into `nginx:alpine`, uses [nginx.conf](nginx.conf) which sets the SPA
   fallback (`try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html`) so React Router deep-links work, 1-year cache headers
   for content-hashed assets, and serves `public/robots.txt` as a real static file at that path.

`VITE_API_URL` is passed as a Docker build-arg from GitHub Actions (value: `https://api.cooking-assistant.app`).
Once baked in it cannot be changed at runtime - to point the bundle at a different API, rebuild the image.

## Environment

A frontend `.env` is optional - copy [.env.example](.env.example) only if you need to override the API
location.

```
# VITE_API_URL=<deployed API origin>
```

- **Dev:** leave `VITE_API_URL` unset. The base URL falls back to `""` ([src/config/env.ts](src/config/env.ts)),
  so requests go to `/api` on the same origin (`:8080`). The Vite dev server proxies `/api` to the backend
  (`VITE_DEV_PROXY_TARGET`, default `http://localhost:3000` - see [vite.config.ts](vite.config.ts)). Keeping
  requests same-origin is what lets the httpOnly auth cookie be first-party without TLS in dev.
- **Production:** set `VITE_API_URL` to the deployed API origin.

## Auth - read this before touching auth code

Auth is a **server-set httpOnly cookie** (`authToken`). The client cannot read it and stores nothing.

- The single shared axios instance ([src/api/client.ts](src/api/client.ts)) is created with
  `withCredentials: true`, so the browser sends/receives the cookie automatically. There is **no**
  `Authorization: Bearer` header and **no** `localStorage` token anywhere.
- **Login** (`useLoginForm` -> `useLoginMutation` in [src/redux/services/authApi.ts](src/redux/services/authApi.ts)) POSTs `/api/login`; the server
  sets the cookie and responds `{ message: "Logged in" }`. On a `429` (too many attempts) it reads
  `retry-after` and soft-locks the submit button until the window passes (escalating lockout, see
  `useLoginLockout`).
- **Logout** POSTs `/api/logout`; the server clears the cookie. Nothing to clean up client-side.
- **Password reset** (`/forgot-password` -> `/reset-password`) and **email verification**
  (`/verify-email`, plus in-app resend/confirm) reuse the same session-token machinery as short-lived,
  purpose-scoped links. Both flows are public routes (see `PUBLIC_PATHS` below).
- **Route gating** (`PrivateRoute`) is server-verified: on mount it fires `useGetMeQuery` (`GET /api/me`).
  While the check is pending it renders a blank screen; on `200` it renders the route; on `401/403` it
  redirects to `/login`; on any other error it shows a session-error message. It does **not** read
  `localStorage` and does **not** inspect a token.
- **401/403 handling** is centralized in the axios response interceptor (`handleAuthError` in
  [src/api/client.ts](src/api/client.ts)): a 401/403 on a protected request hard-redirects to `/login`
  (via `window.location.assign`, since it runs outside React Router - see [src/api/redirect.ts](src/api/redirect.ts)).
  `GET /api/me` and `POST /api/change-password` are exempt (`SKIP_REDIRECT_URLS` - a 401 on
  change-password means "wrong current password", not an expired session), and the public paths are
  exempt too.

## The api/ layer and RTK Query

Pages/hooks never import `axios` directly - the ESLint boundaries rule blocks it outside `src/api/`.
Data flow: page/hook -> RTK Query hook (`redux/services/*`) -> `axiosBaseQuery` -> `apiClient`.

- **[client.ts](src/api/client.ts)** - one `apiClient = axios.create({ baseURL, withCredentials: true })`
  with the single response interceptor described above.
- **[endpoints.ts](src/api/endpoints.ts)** - `API_ROUTES`, a single typed source of truth for every path,
  grouped by domain; parameterized routes are builder functions, e.g. `API_ROUTES.recipes.byId(id)`.
- **[httpError.ts](src/api/httpError.ts)** - normalizes any axios error into a user-facing message, a
  stable error `code` (see the backend's `ERROR_CODES`), a `Retry-After` value, and an HTTP status.
- **`redux/services/baseApi.ts`** - the single RTK Query API slice; each domain file
  (`recipesApi.ts`, `menusApi.ts`, ...) injects its own `useGet*Query` / `use*Mutation` hooks off it.
  Cache invalidation runs off `tagTypes` - a mutation invalidates the tags its queries provide, so
  lists refetch automatically.

## Routing and code splitting

- [App.tsx](src/App.tsx) builds a data router (`createBrowserRouter`, not `<BrowserRouter>`) so forms
  can block in-app navigation away from unsaved edits via `useBlocker`. Every page is
  `React.lazy(() => import("views/..."))`, wrapped in one `<Suspense fallback={<PageSpinner/>}>` inside
  the shared `RootLayout` (which also mounts the theme manager, modal root, offline modal, and toaster).
- Private routes are a data-driven `PRIVATE_ROUTES` array rendered as children of a single
  `<Route element={<PrivateRoute/>}>` layout route. Public routes (login, registration, forgot/reset
  password, verify email), and the `*` 404 sit outside the guard.
- All paths come from [src/constants/routes.ts](src/constants/routes.ts) (`ROUTES`, path builders like
  `recipeDetailsPath(id)`, and `PUBLIC_PATHS`).

### Routes

| Path                                                   | Page                                | Access  |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------- |

| `/add-menu`, `/menu/:id`, `/change-menu/:id`           | Menu create / details / edit        | private |
| `/ingredients`                                         | IngredientsPage (pantry)            | private |
| `/stats`                                               | StatsPage (charts)                  | private |
| `/profile`, `/settings`                                | ProfilePage, SettingsPage           | private |
| `*`                                                    | NotFoundPage                        | public  |

## State

Server data is cached with RTK Query (see above). Everything else - local UI state, one-off derived
values - lives in custom hooks under [src/hooks/](src/hooks/), composed from smaller hooks. Client/UI
state that needs to be shared across the tree (session, the modal manager, toasts, theme) lives in
Redux slices instead. Filtering/search on list pages goes through a shared declarative registry
(`utils/filters/`, `hooks/useListFilters.ts` for URL-backed lists, `hooks/useClientFilters.ts` for
local-state lists) rather than ad hoc component state.

## Modals - one queue, one renderer

Every modal in the app goes through a single FIFO queue in
[redux/slices/uiSlice.ts](src/redux/slices/uiSlice.ts) (`ui.queue`), and
[components/modals/ModalRoot/](src/components/modals/ModalRoot/) is the **only** place a modal is
rendered. `selectActiveModal` returns the head of the queue, so exactly one modal is ever on screen -
opening a second while one is showing makes it wait, never stack and never clobber the first. That
collision was real: two notice hooks could fire in the same tick and the second silently destroyed
the first, which had already marked itself "shown" and so never came back.

Rules that follow from this:

- **Never render a modal in place.** No page or component mounts its own modal - it dispatches
  `openModal({ type, ...payload })` and lets `ModalRoot` render it. `NewsModal` and `OfflineModal`
  used to be mounted directly and could therefore land on top of a queued modal; both were moved onto
  the queue in 4.2.
- **`openModal` ignores a type that is already queued.** A modal covers the screen, so a second one of
  the same type is always an accidental double dispatch (a double-clicked delete button), never a real
  second request. Same idea as notistack's `preventDuplicate`.
- **A modal closes itself** by dispatching `closeModal(modalId)`; the next queued modal is promoted
  automatically.
- **State-driven modals get a hook that owns the lifecycle**, not local component state - see
  [hooks/useOfflineNotice.ts](src/hooks/useOfflineNotice.ts), which enqueues on connectivity loss and
  withdraws on reconnect.
- **A "shown once" marker is written when the modal is actually presented**, not when it is enqueued -
  otherwise a notice still waiting its turn is recorded as seen and never returns
  (`useExpiredIngredientsNotice`, `useCalorieLimitNotice`).

Adding a modal is three edits and no change to the queue itself: a key in `MODAL_TYPE` plus its
`<Name>ModalInput`/`<Name>Modal` interfaces added to the `ModalInput`/`ActiveModal` unions, a branch in
`ModalRoot`, and a `dispatch(openModal(...))` at the trigger.

**Toasts are a separate queue on purpose.** `notificationsSlice` is its own FIFO array with dedupe and
`MAX_VISIBLE = 3` ([components/ui/Toasts/](src/components/ui/Toasts/)). Toasts are non-blocking and
several are visible at once; modals are blocking and strictly serialized. Don't merge the two.

## Internationalization

[src/i18n/index.ts](src/i18n/index.ts) initializes i18next with inlined JSON resources (synchronous,
`useSuspense: false`), `lng: "en"`, `defaultNS: "common"`. One namespace file per domain lives under
`src/i18n/locales/en/` (`common`, `auth`, `recipes`, `menu`, `ingredients`, `stats`, `profile`,
`settings`, `home`, `news`). `catalog` (the 739-item ingredient catalog, ~29.5 KB) is deliberately NOT
in that inlined set - [src/i18n/loadCatalog.ts](src/i18n/loadCatalog.ts)'s `ensureCatalogLoaded()` adds
it lazily via a dynamic `import()`, called once from `AppShell`'s module scope, so the public auth pages
(login, register, forgot/reset password, verify email) never download it. Components/hooks read strings
via `useTranslation("<namespace>")`; non-React code (Redux middleware, utilities) uses `i18next.t()`
directly. Every user-visible string must go through i18n - no hardcoded English in components, hooks, or
Redux middleware.

## Layering, ESLint boundaries, path aliases

- **Bare path aliases**, never `../` across folders: `api/`, `components/`, `hooks/`, `views/`, `utils/`,
  `types/`, `constants/`, `config/`, `redux/`, `i18n/`, `assets/`, `styles/`, `test/` (defined in
  `tsconfig.app.json`, mirrored in `vite.config.ts` and `jest.config.cjs`).
- **`eslint-plugin-boundaries`** declares the layers and enforces (as errors): components may not import
  pages, and only the `api/` layer may import `axios`.
- Other guards: `simple-import-sort` (layer-aware order), `import/no-cycle`, `no-restricted-imports`
  banning `../`, a local rule requiring a named constant for any 3+ part logical condition, `max-lines`,
  and `complexity`.

## Testing

Jest 30 + `@swc/jest` + React Testing Library + jsdom. ~224 co-located `__tests__/` files across `api/`,
`redux/`, `hooks/`, `components/`, `views/`, `utils/`, and `constants/`; `npm run test:coverage` enforces
an 80% global threshold (branches/functions/lines/statements).

Read [src/test/jest.setup.ts](src/test/jest.setup.ts) and [jest.config.cjs](jest.config.cjs) before
writing tests. Conventions:

- Co-located `__tests__/`, named `<Unit>.test.ts(x)`; `it("should ...")` names.
- Prefer `act` over `waitFor` (per the repo rule); render hooks with `renderHook`.
- Use `renderWithRouter` from [src/test/router.tsx](src/test/router.tsx) (defaults to a non-root route
  so tests aren't coupled to whatever page currently lives at `/`); assert navigation against the
  shared `mockNavigate`.
- **Mocking**: both RTK Query service tests and component/page/hook tests `jest.mock("api/client")`
  and drive real RTK Query hooks through a real store (`makeTestStore`/`setupStore`), asserting
  against the typed mocks in [src/test/apiClientMock.ts](src/test/apiClientMock.ts)
  (`mockedGet`/`mockedPost`/...) - there's no separate per-domain wrapper to mock instead. `config/env`
  and `config/logger` are mocked globally through `moduleNameMapper`.
- No `as any` casts; real domain types from `types/*` for fixtures.

## Conventions

- Talk to the backend only through `redux/services/*` (RTK Query) or `src/api/*`; never import `axios`
  in a page, hook, or component.
- All user-facing copy goes through i18n (`useTranslation`), not string literals.
- SCSS modules for styling, one per component; shared breakpoints/mixins live in `src/styles/`.
  Stylelint guards CSS/SCSS.
- New routes go in [src/constants/routes.ts](src/constants/routes.ts) and the `PRIVATE_ROUTES` array
  (or the public route list) in [App.tsx](src/App.tsx); add the page as a `React.lazy` import.
- Hand-authored SVG icons (not from `lucide-react`) live in `src/components/icons/`, one component per
  file, path data traced verbatim from the design mockups.

## Known oddities (not bugs to fix in unrelated changes)

- The backend DB column `quantity_person_ingradient` (missing letters) keeps its misspelling - it is the
  real column name and appears verbatim in API responses. The frontend pantry **folder** was corrected to
  `person-ingredients` (the matching DB column stays misspelled).

## Versioning

The whole project shares one version and one changelog at the repo root. This package's version in
[package.json](package.json) marks the last release in which the frontend changed. See the
[root README](../README.md#versioning-and-changelog) and [root CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).
